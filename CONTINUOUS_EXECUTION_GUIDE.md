# 🔄 Continuous Execution Guide

Your stealth bot system is now set up for undetectable continuous operation with multiple execution strategies.

## 🚀 Available Continuous Modes

### 1. Standard Continuous (30 min run, 5 min sleep)
```bash
python run_stealth_bot.py --mode continuous
```
- Runs for 30 minutes visiting your X/Twitter links
- Sleeps for 5 minutes
- Repeats indefinitely
- Uses HTTP stealth bot (most reliable)

### 2. Fast Continuous (15 min run, 3 min sleep)
```bash
python run_stealth_bot.py --mode fast
```
- Runs for 15 minutes
- Sleeps for 3 minutes
- More frequent execution cycles
- Better for high-frequency visits

### 3. Multi-Strategy Parallel
```bash
python run_stealth_bot.py --mode multi
```
- Runs HTTP bot every 45 minutes
- Runs Firefox bot every 60 minutes
- Both strategies run in parallel
- Maximum coverage with different user agents

### 4. Custom Timing
```bash
python continuous_stealth_bot.py --execution-time 20 --sleep-time 10
```
- Set custom execution and sleep times
- Execution time in minutes
- Sleep time in minutes

## 📊 Current Performance

**Both bots achieved 100% success rate:**

**Ultimate Stealth Bot (HTTP):**
- 11/11 X/Twitter links visited successfully
- 63.91 seconds execution time
- 5.81 seconds average per visit

**Multi-Browser Bot (Firefox):**
- 11/11 X/Twitter links visited successfully  
- Different user agents for each visit
- Full browser automation with JavaScript

## 🎯 Your X/Twitter Links

The system automatically visits these links with random intervals:

## 🔧 Stealth Features Active

- **User Agent Rotation**: Different browser signatures for each visit
- **Random Delays**: 2-8 seconds between requests with micro-variations
- **Anti-Detection**: No browser fingerprinting, realistic headers
- **Session Management**: Multiple sessions for different strategies
- **Human-like Patterns**: Reading simulation, scrolling, mouse movements

- `logs/continuous_bot.log` - Continuous execution logs
- `logs/ultimate_stealth_bot.log` - HTTP bot execution details
- `logs/multi_browser_bot.log` - Firefox bot execution details
- `logs/visits.jsonl` - Structured visit data

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add more links in `links/target_links.py`:
```python
X_LINKS.append("https://x.com/new_account/status/123456789")
```

Modify delays by editing the command in `continuous_stealth_bot.py`:
```python
self.bot_command = "python ultimate_stealth_bot.py --categories x_links --delay-min 3 --delay-max 8"
```

## 🚀 Recommended Usage

**For maximum stealth and reliability:**
```bash
python run_stealth_bot.py --mode continuous
```

**For high-frequency visits:**
```bash
python run_stealth_bot.py --mode fast
```

**For maximum coverage:**
```bash
python run_stealth_bot.py --mode multi
```

Your stealth bot system will now run continuously, visiting all your X/Twitter links with different user agents and random intervals while maintaining undetectable operation.
